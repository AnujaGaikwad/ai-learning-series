AI Learning Series 
– Computer Vision with OpenCV

A structured collection of hands-on computer vision projects built using Python and OpenCV.
This repository focuses on practical understanding of image processing, motion detection, object tracking, and face detection through real-time webcam applications.

The goal of this repository is to learn by building, gradually progressing from foundational image processing to real-time computer vision systems.
